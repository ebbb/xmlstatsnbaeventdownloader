# xmlstats-nba-event-downloader
Python 3.5 project to download NBA basketball events from [xmlstats](https://erikberg.com/api) for a date range defined in the main.py file.

This project is me learning as I go about writing better python code as I go and is compiled with python 3.5.

There may be dependencies which are not defined correctly this will be updated as I go along.

To setup:

1. Clone the repo
2. add directories for "data" and "logging"
3. add a config.py file with the following contents

accessToken = 'my token'

user_agent = 'my user agent'

-- Adding the files and directorys can be done via the setup.sh script, then you just need to added the variables above.

Details of the above can be found at the site https://erikberg.com/account/token and https://erikberg.com/api
