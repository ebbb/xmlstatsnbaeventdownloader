# xmlstats-nba-event-downloader
Python project to download events from xmlstats: https://erikberg.com/api/endpoints/events

This project is me learning as I go about writing better python code and is compiled with python 3.5

There may be dependencies which are not defined correctly this will be updated as I go along

The project needs a config.py file adding to work which should be of a format like this

accessToken = 'my token'

user_agent = 'my user agent'

Details of the above can be found at the site https://erikberg.com/account/token and https://erikberg.com/api
